          correct: 1,
          explanation: "The UK edition includes concepts for specific brand-name and pack-size drug products. The UK's close integration with dm+d means that its SNOMED CT extension has a much more granular and specific set of concepts for drug products than the international edition, which focuses on generic drugs. The US also has its own extension for drug concepts, but it is not a direct analog to the UK model."
