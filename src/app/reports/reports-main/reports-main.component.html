    <h1>SNOMED CT Changes reports</h1>
    <p class="intro">Maintaining the integrity and usefulness of a clinical terminology like SNOMED CT requires 
        continuous updates, including concept inactivations, fully specified name (FSN) changes, and the introduction 
        of new concepts. These updates ensure that the terminology remains aligned with clinical practice, evolving 
        medical knowledge, and interoperability needs across health systems. This page provides access to detailed 
        reports of these changes, offering transparency for implementers, terminology managers, and system developers 
        who rely on SNOMED CT for clinical decision support, coding, and analytics.</p>
    <p class="intro">This aligns with the principle of graceful evolution, which emphasizes that terminologies 
        should change in a way that minimizes disruption to users. SNOMED CT follows this principle by ensuring that 
        inactivated concepts have clear historical relationships to their replacements, FSN changes history is fully tracked, 
        and new concepts integrate seamlessly into existing hierarchies. <span class="text-sm">

    <p class="intro">While this information exists in the RF2 release files, it is spread across multiple tables and 
        requires complex queries to interpret. These reports simplify access, helping implementers identify the volume of changes over time 
        and track updates efficiently and ensuring smooth transitions with minimal risk of misinterpretation. <span class="text-sm">

    <p class="intro">To further support users in managing terminology changes, SNOMED CT provides several tools and 
        features that facilitate adaptation. Historical associations link inactive concepts to their active equivalents, 
        ensuring continuity in clinical records and analytics. The Expression Constraint Language (ECL) includes history 
        functions that leverages the historical associations in queries, making it easier to include inactive content in 
        clinical queries. Additionally, SNOMED International offers structured reports and tooling that help implementers 
        integrate updates seamlessly into their systems. These mechanisms ensure that SNOMED CT remains a reliable and 
        evolving standard while minimizing the impact of inevitable terminology changes.
