                      <h4>Problem list</h4>
                      <p>Allergy or intolerance can also be recorded in the EHR as a problem. The problem list is normally restricted to SNOMED CT 
                        concepts from three hierarchies – Clinical finding, Event and Finding with explicit context. This corresponds either to the 
                        FHIR finding based AllergyIntolerance resource data model or the FHIR Condition resource.</p>
                      <p>For practical guidance using SNOMED CT to document hypersensitivity to specific substances in a problem list, it is suggested 
                        to map to the appropriate concepts under the 473011001 |Allergic condition (finding)|hierarchies. This is due to the lack of 
                        sufficient content under 609433001 |Hypersensitivity disposition (finding)|and 421961002 |Hypersensitivity reaction (disorder)| 
                        and that many of the concepts under 609328004 |Allergic disposition (finding)|and 419076005 |Allergic reaction (disorder)| have unclear 
                        mechanisms which may actually represent non-allergic hypersensitivity. Please note that SNOMED international does not plan to create 
                        new children concepts of hypersensitivity disposition to specific substances unless more than one Member country would submit a 
                        request for them to answer to an active use-case.</p>
                      <p>Almost all allergy concepts are modeled by substances in SNOMED CT. A very small number of allergy concepts are modeled by 
                        products but with explicit description for the specific intended meaning. Records of allergy to multiple substances or to 
                        multi-ingredient products should be recoded at the product level and updated when more specific information becomes available 
                        (e.g., positive sensitivity test to one specific ingredient of the mix).</p>
                      <p>Vaccine allergy is an example where allergy concepts are modeled using a product concept.  For example, ‘Allergy to component 
                        of vaccine product (finding)’ with a synonym ‘vaccine allergy’ has been modeled by vaccine product. The concept represents 
                        that allergy is caused by any substance in a vaccine product.</p>
                      <p>To record the level of certainty or verification status, it is recommended to use additional data elements in the EHR information 
                        model. Even though it is possible to utilize the SNOMED CT model for ‘situation with explicit context’ to express certainty, 
                        this is not recommended due to potential ambiguity. For example, “suspected penicillin allergy” can mean uncertainty with 
                        the condition (is it real allergy?) or with the causative agent (is it penicillin?). Even though SNOMED CT editorial 
                        guideline is clear that the first interpretation is correct, it is better to use other methods to represent the uncertainty 
                        to avoid confusion.</p>
